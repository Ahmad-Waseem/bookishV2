# BookishV2
A NextJs project equipped with principles of MongoDB and Mongoose project, targeting concepts like Client Side Rendering, Server-Side Rendering, Static-Site-Generation, ISR, SWR and more!
The mini-project is the sleeker version of [Bookish](https://github.com/Ahmad-Waseem/bookish) and includes dynamic and nested Api routing with useEffect, useState and useContext hooks provided by React!
ChakraUI has also been implemented, so legacy versions of React .i.e. 18.* are preffered
